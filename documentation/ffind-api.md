# How to set up an API that works with FFIND
---
FFIND was designed to work with any type of API backend. In order to work, the FFIND backend must provide the following functionality:

1. Return metadata about a specific image
2. Return metadata about all images
3. Return metadata about a dataset
4. Return metadata for all datasets
5. Provide a list of images in a dataset

This document provides an overview of how we tackled these problems when building Pancreatlas along with relevant code samples so that you can get a FFIND installation up and running quickly.
