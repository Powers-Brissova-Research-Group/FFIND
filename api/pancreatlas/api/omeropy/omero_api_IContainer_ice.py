        Provides methods for dealing with the core Pojos of OME.
        Included are:
        Projects, Datasets, Images.
        Read API
        The names of the methods correlate to how the function operates:
        load: start at container objects and work down toward the
        leaves, returning hierarchy (Project-&gt;Dataset-&gt;Image
        find: start at leaf objects and work up to containers,
        returning hierarchy
        get: retrieves only leaves in the hierarchy (currently
        only Images)
        Options Mechanism
        The options are used to add some constraints to the generic method
        e.g. load hierarchy trees images for a given user. This
        mechanism should give us enough flexibility to extend the API if
        necessary, e.g. in some cases we might want to retrieve the images
        with or without annotations
        Most methods take such an options map which is built
        on the client-side using the Parameters class. The
        currently supported options are:
        annotator(Integer): If key exists but value null,
        annotations are retrieved for all objects in the hierarchy where
        they exist; if a valid experimenterID, annotations are only
        retrieved for that user. May not be used
        be all methods. Default: all annotations
        leaves(Boolean): if FALSE omits images from the returned
        hierarchy. May not be used by all methods. Default: true
        experimenter(Integer): enables filtering on a
        per-experimenter basis. This option has a method-specific (and
        possibly context-specific) meaning. Please see the individual
        methods.
        group(Integer): enables filtering on a per-group basis.
        The experimenter value is ignored if present and instead a
        similar filtering is done using all experimenters in the
        given group.
        Write API
        As outlined in TODO, the semantics of the Omero write API are based
        on three rules:
        IObject-valued fields for which isLoaded() returns
        false are assumed filtered
        Collection-valued fields that are null are assumed filtered
        Collection-valued fields for which
        getDetails().isFiltered(String collectionName) returns
        true are assumed filtered. TODO: should we accept isFiltered for
        all fields?
        In each of these cases, the server will reload that given field
        before attempting to save the graph.
        For all write calls, the options map (see below) must contain the
        userId and the userGroupId for the newly created objects. TODO
        umask.

            Retrieves hierarchy trees in various hierarchies that
            contain the specified Images.
            This method will look for all the containers containing the
            specified Images and then for all containers containing
            those containers and on up the container hierarchy.
            This method returns a Set with all root nodes
            that were
            found. Every root node is linked to the found objects and
            so on until the leaf nodes, which are

            rootNodeType, any of its containees or an
            omero.model.Image.
            For example, say that you pass in the ids of six Images:
            i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6.
            If the P/D/I hierarchy in the DB looks like this:

            Finally, this method will only retrieve the nodes
            that are connected in a tree to the specified leaf image
            nodes. Back to the previous example, if d1
            contained image img500, then the returned
            object would not contain img500. In a
